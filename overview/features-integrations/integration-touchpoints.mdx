# Integrating CodeBoarding

CodeBoarding offers seamless integration options that embed its powerful codebase analysis capabilities directly into your development workflows. Whether you want interactive in-IDE diagrams, automated documentation generation in CI/CD pipelines, or serving documentation snapshots to AI assistants, CodeBoarding supports tailored integration paths to unlock maximum productivity.

---

## Why Integrate CodeBoarding?

Modern software development demands quick insight into complex Python codebases without interrupting workflows. CodeBoarding’s integrations let you achieve this by embedding high-level architectural visualizations and documentation where you need it most:

- Within your editor, so you can explore and understand code visually as you write.
- In your CI/CD pipeline, automating updated documentation delivery on every commit.
- Served live to AI-based assistants that augment developer productivity.

These integrations transform CodeBoarding from a standalone tool into a natural, continuous companion for developers.

## Integration Paths

### 1. VS Code Extension — In-IDE Diagrams

The **CodeBoarding VS Code Extension** integrates interactive diagrams directly within the Visual Studio Code environment.

**Benefits:**
- Instantly visualize project architecture without leaving the IDE.
- Navigate complex relationships between modules graphically.
- Reduce context switching and dramatically speed up onboarding.

**How it Works:**
- The extension communicates with your local or remote CodeBoarding analysis outputs.
- It renders interactive Mermaid.js diagrams inline, letting you expand or drill down as needed.

**Getting Started Tip:**
- Install the extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Codeboarding.codeboarding).
- Configure project paths and refresh interval settings to sync your analysis output.

---

### 2. GitHub Action — CI/CD Documentation Automation

The **CodeBoarding GitHub Action** enables automated generation of up-to-date architectural diagrams and documentation as part of your repository’s CI/CD workflows.

**Benefits:**
- Automatically generate and update onboarding docs on every push or pull request.
- Ensure architectural documentation stays in sync with code changes.
- Integrate with GitHub Pages or other documentation hosts seamlessly.

**High-Level Workflow:**
- On a trigger event (push, PR), the action clones your repository.
- Runs static analysis and AI-driven modeling.
- Produces Markdown and Mermaid.js diagrams.
- Commits the generated docs back to a branch or publishes artifacts.

**Configuration Highlights:**
- Use the provided [github_action.py](https://github.com/CodeBoarding/CodeBoarding/blob/main/github_action.py) script as a reference.
- Provide required environment variables like `GITHUB_TOKEN` for repository access.

**Example Usage:**
```yaml
name: Generate CodeBoarding Docs
on: [push]
jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run CodeBoarding
        uses: codeboarding/codeboarding-action@main
        with:
          repo-url: ${{ github.repository }}
          output-dir: ./docs/generated
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

---

### 3. MCP Server — Serving Docs to AI Assistants

The **MCP Server** integration serves CodeBoarding-generated documentation snapshots to AI assistant clients such as ClaudeCode, VSCode AI extensions, or Cursor.

**Benefits:**
- Enables AI agents to consume concise, structured architecture insights.
- Enhances AI-assisted code comprehension, summarization, and navigation.
- Provides a standardized backend for feeding up-to-date knowledge into AI tooling.

**Integration Overview:**
- The MCP Server hosts JSON or Markdown representations of analysis results.
- AI clients query the server to fetch architectural models and context.
- The server supports rapid updates as new analyses complete.

**Setup Tips:**
- Ensure MCP Server configuration points to your latest CodeBoarding output.
- Secure access using tokens or other authentication as required.

## High-Level Configuration for Common Integrations

Regardless of integration choice, a few configuration elements are shared and essential:

| Setting                    | Purpose                                         | Example                   |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `REPO_ROOT`                | Local path for cloning repositories             | `./repos`                 |
| `ROOT_RESULT`              | Output directory for generated docs/diagrams   | `./results`               |
| `PROJECT_ROOT`             | Absolute path to your source project root       | `/home/user/myproject`    |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`             | Token for GitHub API access, private repos     | `<your_github_token>`     |
| `DIAGRAM_DEPTH_LEVEL`      | Controls level of detail in generated diagrams | `1` (default)             |

For CI/CD or extension-specific setups, environment variables and additional config options may be required;
refer to integration-specific README files or the central [configuration documentation](https://github.com/CodeBoarding/CodeBoarding/blob/main/.codeboarding/Orchestration_Workflow.md).

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Keep diagrams focused:** Adjust `DIAGRAM_DEPTH_LEVEL` to balance detail and usability.
- **Version control generated docs:** For CI/CD, commit generated documentation to a dedicated branch to track evolution.
- **Automate refreshes:** In VS Code Extension settings, enable auto-refresh to keep diagrams current.
- **Secure tokens:** Use secrets management for tokens in automation workflows.
- **Start small:** Begin integration with simple projects to validate your pipeline before scaling.
