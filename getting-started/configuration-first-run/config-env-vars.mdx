# Configuration & Environment Variables

Welcome to the Configuration & Environment Variables guide for **CodeBoarding**. This page helps you **understand and set** the essential environment variables required to configure CodeBoarding effectively. Correct configuration ensures your system is ready to generate high-quality onboarding diagrams and documentation from your Python codebases.

## 1. Understanding the Core Environment Variables

CodeBoarding relies on several environment variables to control its behavior, paths, and integration with LLM providers. Below is a practical checklist of the most important variables and what they do.

| Variable               | Purpose                                                                                     | Required/Optional           | Typical Default             |

## 2. Setting Up Your Environment Variables

Follow these step-by-step instructions to configure your environment for your first CodeBoarding run.

### Step 1: Select and Configure Your LLM Provider Keys

CodeBoarding supports multiple LLM providers. You need to choose **at least one** LLM provider key for the analysis engine. According to our experience, **Google Gemini‑2.5‑Pro** provides top-notch results.

```bash
# Example for setting environment variables on Linux/macOS
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
# or
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
# or
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="your-aws-bedrock-token"
```

<Tip>
If working with private GitHub repositories, also export your `GITHUB_TOKEN` with appropriate permissions for cloning.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Define Core Paths for Repositories and Outputs

Set the `REPO_ROOT` to where CodeBoarding will clone repositories locally, and `ROOT_RESULT` for where generated markdown and diagrams will be saved.

```bash
export REPO_ROOT="./repos"
export ROOT_RESULT="./results"
```

These paths can be absolute or relative. Ensure those directories are writable by your user.

### Step 3: Set Diagram Generation Depth

Control the max level of abstraction for your generated diagrams by setting:

```bash
export DIAGRAM_DEPTH_LEVEL=1
```

Increasing this depth increases detail but also runtime and output complexity.

### Step 4: Optional Configuration for Development and Tracing

If you want to enable tracing or use LangSmith for monitoring LLM calls:

```bash
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT="https://your-langsmith-endpoint"
export LANGSMITH_PROJECT="my-codeboarding-project"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-langchain-api-key"
```

These are optional but can provide valuable insights during development or debugging.

### Step 5: Persist Environment Variables

For consistent use, save your variables in a `.env` file at your project root:

```ini
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
REPO_ROOT=./repos
ROOT_RESULT=./results
DIAGRAM_DEPTH_LEVEL=1
CACHING_DOCUMENTATION=false
# Optional tokens
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
```

Use `dotenv` to load this automatically when running CodeBoarding.

## 3. Practical Validation & Quick Checks

After setting environment variables, validate your setup:

- Run `printenv | grep -E 'OPENAI_API_KEY|GOOGLE_API_KEY|ANTHROPIC_API_KEY|AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK|REPO_ROOT|ROOT_RESULT'` to confirm variables are set.

- Confirm your `REPO_ROOT` directory exists or will be created during the first run.

- Check caching setting:

```bash
python -c "import os; print('Caching enabled:', os.getenv('CACHING_DOCUMENTATION', 'false').lower() in ('1','true','yes'))"
```

- Ensure you have network access to GitHub and chosen LLM API endpoints.

---

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Prioritize LLM keys**: CodeBoarding selects your LLM based on key priority: OpenAI first, then Anthropic, Google, and AWS Bedrock last.

- **Keep keys secure**: Never commit API keys to source control.

- **Use caching**: Enable `CACHING_DOCUMENTATION=true` if regenerating documentation repeatedly to optimize performance.

- **Proper directory permissions**: Ensure write access to `REPO_ROOT` and `ROOT_RESULT`.

- **Consistent environment**: Use virtual environments and `.env` files to keep configuration consistent.

- **Remember depth impact**: Deeper diagram levels produce richer diagrams at the cost of longer execution time.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Configuration Issues">
<Accordion title="LLM API Key Not Set or Invalid">
Verify your API key environment variables are correctly set and valid for the provider.

```bash
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
``` 

If empty, ensure you've exported or put them in your `.env` file.

Check your network connectivity to provider endpoints.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="REPO_ROOT is Missing or Not Writable">
Before first use, ensure the directory in `REPO_ROOT` exists or that CodeBoarding can create it.

```bash
mkdir -p ./repos
chmod u+rwx ./repos
```

If you see errors about missing repository paths during generation, this is likely the cause.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Output Not Generating as Expected">
Confirm `ROOT_RESULT` path is set and writable.

Review logs for permission issues or disk space errors.

Check caching setting in case cached results are being used unexpectedly.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
