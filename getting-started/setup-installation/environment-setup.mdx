# Environment Setup

Welcome to the environment setup guide for CodeBoarding. This page provides you with clear, step-by-step instructions to create a Python virtual environment and synchronize all required dependencies using the recommended tooling. Whether you're a first-time user or an advanced developer, this guide ensures you get your environment ready quickly and correctly.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Checks

Before starting, ensure your system meets these necessities:

- **Python 3.11** or higher installed and accessible via command line.
- Internet connectivity to download packages.
- Access to your terminal or command prompt.

> 💡 **Tip:** If you have multiple Python versions installed, explicitly specify Python 3.11 when creating your virtual environment.

---

## 2. Creating a Virtual Environment

Isolation of dependencies through a virtual environment is vital for managing CodeBoarding’s requirements without conflicts.

### Step-by-Step

1. **Open your terminal**.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your CodeBoarding project.

```bash
cd /path/to/CodeBoarding
```

3. Create a virtual environment named `venv` using Python 3.11:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
```

This command leverages `uv` tooling to consistently create a virtual environment. If you prefer manual setup, you can use:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the environment:

- On **macOS/Linux**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- On **Windows**:

  ```powershell
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

5. Verify the correct Python version is active:

```bash
python --version
# Output should be: Python 3.11.x
```

> ⚠️ If you see a different Python version, double-check your virtual environment creation and activation steps.

---

## 3. Synchronizing Dependencies

CodeBoarding uses a carefully curated set of Python packages. To ensure version consistency, use the `uv pip sync` command.

### Install dependencies

Run this command inside the activated virtual environment:

```bash
uv pip sync
```

- This ensures all dependencies listed in the lock file are installed exactly as specified.
- It will remove any extraneous packages to keep your environment clean.

### Verification

- After installation, confirm by running:
  
```bash
pip list
```

You should see critical packages such as `langchain`, `dotenv`, `google-api-core`, among others.

> 🔍 If you encounter errors during installation, check your internet connection and ensure your pip is up to date (`pip install --upgrade pip`).

## 4. Setting Up Environment Variables

CodeBoarding depends on several environment variables for configuration, especially for AI provider API keys.

### Typical environment variables to set:

```bash
# Choose only one LLM provider key (depending on which service you intend to use)
OPENAI_API_KEY=                 # For OpenAI GPT
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=              # For Anthropic Claude
GOOGLE_API_KEY=                 # For Google Gemini
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=       # For AWS Bedrock

# Configuration and paths
CACHING_DOCUMENTATION=false      # Enable or disable documentation caching
REPO_ROOT=./repos                # Path to where repos will be cloned
ROOT_RESULT=./results            # Output directory for generated files
PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/CodeBoarding # Your local CodeBoarding repo root
DIAGRAM_DEPTH_LEVEL=1            # Diagram generation detail depth

# Optional
GITHUB_TOKEN=                   # For private GitHub repo access
LANGSMITH_TRACING=false          # LangSmith tracing flag
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=              # LangSmith endpoint URL
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=               # LangSmith project name
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=               # Additional LangChain API key
```

### How to set environment variables:

- Create a `.env` file in your project root with the variables above.
- Alternatively, export them in your shell profile or set before running commands.

> 🛡️ **Security Tip:** Never commit your secrets or API keys to source control.

---

## 5. Validation & Best Practices

Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed:

- **Run a quick validation:**

  ```bash
  python demo.py https://github.com/example/repo --output-dir ./results
  ```

- This will trigger a basic repository analysis using your environment.

- Confirm no error messages appear regarding missing packages or keys.

- Verify the results directory is populated post-run.

> 💡 **Tip:** Our testing shows the best diagram results with the Google Gemini-2.5-Pro LLM provider, so if you have access, prioritize setting `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues During Environment Setup">
<Accordion title="Python version mismatch or not found">
Ensure Python 3.11 is installed and correctly referenced. Use `python3.11 --version` to check. Adjust virtual environment creation commands if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dependency installation fails or times out">
Make sure your network allows package downloads. Upgrade pip using `pip install --upgrade pip`. If behind proxy, configure environment accordingly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Environment variables not loaded">
Confirm you have a `.env` file and that `dotenv` is loading it properly. Restart terminal or IDE after making changes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="API key errors or missing keys">
Check that you set one and only one LLM provider API key. Verify key validity and expiration on provider portals.
