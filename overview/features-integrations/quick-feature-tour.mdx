# Quick Feature Overview

Unlock the power of automated codebase comprehension with CodeBoarding’s core features. This page introduces you to the essential capabilities that enable CodeBoarding to transform raw source code into high-value, interactive architectural diagrams and onboarding documentation.

---

## Why Quick Feature Overview Matters

When you first engage with a new codebase, understanding component relationships, system structure, and architecture can be overwhelming. CodeBoarding cuts through this complexity by extracting meaningful insights from your code and presenting them in a clear, actionable format. This guide summarizes the key features that drive this process.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Extraction of Module Relationships
CodeBoarding starts by statically analyzing your source code to extract modules and their interconnections. This includes:

- Parsing control flow graphs (CFGs) to identify dependencies and call relationships.
- Detecting module boundaries automatically.

**Benefit:** Gain a concrete, structural map of your project’s internal architecture without manual effort.

### 2. Multi-level LLM-driven Abstraction
Beyond raw relationships, CodeBoarding leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide layered abstractions:

- Summarizes complex modules into digestible concepts.
- Recognizes design patterns, component roles, and architectural layers.
- Supports multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and AWS Bedrock.

**Benefit:** Understand not just how parts connect, but also what those parts mean and do within your system.

### 3. Interactive Diagram Generation
Visuals are central to comprehension. CodeBoarding outputs:

- Interactive diagrams based on Mermaid.js syntax, easily embeddable in Markdown, HTML, or MDX format.
- Multi-level visualization allowing deep dives from high-level overviews to detailed module internals.

**Benefit:** Navigate your system architecture interactively, integrating diagrams seamlessly into existing documentation or development environments.

### 4. Documentation Automation
CodeBoarding automates the generation of onboarding documents that combine architecture, relationships, and insights:

- Generates Markdown, HTML, or MDX output formats for diverse use cases.
- Embeds interactive diagrams and detailed explanations.

**Benefit:** Rapidly produce consistent, developer-friendly onboarding resources that reduce ramp-up times.

## Real-World Usage Scenario

Imagine onboarding to a large, unfamiliar Python codebase with tangled dependencies and sparse documentation. With CodeBoarding, you:

1. Trigger analysis through a GitHub repository URL or CI pipeline.
2. Receive an interactive Mermaid.js diagram visualizing module relationships.
3. Explore automatically generated documentation explaining each component’s role, abstraction layers, and code connections.
4. Quickly identify critical areas or architectural patterns to accelerate development and decision-making.

## How This Page Fits In

This overview aligns directly with the broader [Architecture & Core Concepts](https://www.codeboarding.org/overview/architecture-core-concepts) and [Integrations](https://www.codeboarding.org/overview/features-integrations/integration-touchpoints) sections of CodeBoarding documentation, providing a foundation before deep-diving into setup or system architecture details.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Start with shallow depth:** Use the default diagram depth level (configurable through environment variable `DIAGRAM_DEPTH_LEVEL`) to get manageable initial outputs.
- **Choose your LLM strategically:** Google Gemini-2.5-Pro is recommended for complex diagram generation.
- **Embed diagrams in documentation portals:** Mermaid.js output works well within Markdown-based wikis and static site generators.
- **Leverage automation for CI/CD:** Use GitHub Actions integration to automate diagram regeneration on code changes.


---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **No diagrams generated:** Verify that the static analysis completed successfully and that your codebase uses supported languages and structures.
- **LLM abstraction incomplete or ambiguous:** Try different LLM providers or increase your diagram depth level.
- **Output files missing or misplaced:** Ensure environment variables like `REPO_ROOT` and `ROOT_RESULT` are correctly configured.
