# AI-Driven Abstraction & Component Modeling

Unlock the power of large language models (LLMs) within CodeBoarding's AI Analysis Engine to generate high-level abstractions and comprehensive component models from raw static code data. This guide walks you through how the AbstractionAgent and related LLM-powered agents transform intricate code structures into digestible, multi-level insights that drive accurate architectural understanding and interactive documentation.

---

## Introduction

CodeBoarding leverages LLM agents to enhance static analysis data by discovering architectural patterns, abstracting core components, and generating layered explanations. The AI analysis employs a multi-agent system where specialized agents perform distinct cognitive tasks that collectively produce a rich, high-level model of your codebase.

Specifically, the **AbstractionAgent** focuses on extracting meaningful abstractions by distilling complex code details into manageable concepts, enabling faster onboarding, clearer documentation, and actionable insights.

---

## The Role of Abstraction in CodeBoarding

Think of CodeBoarding's abstraction process as turning a sprawling city map cluttered with every street sign into a clean, layered atlas highlighting districts, important landmarks, and transit pathways — making navigation and orientation effortless.

The AbstractionAgent accomplishes this by:

- **Summarizing code sections:** Condensing detailed source code and graph information into concise descriptive insights.
- **Identifying design patterns:** Recognizing common architectural structures (e.g., MVC, microservices) to contextualize components.
- **Generating multi-level explanations:** Creating summaries that range from granular details to overarching component roles.

This abstraction enables users to grasp the architecture without wading through raw code or overwhelming static graphs.

## How the Abstraction Agent Works

The AbstractionAgent is a specialized AI entity within the AI Analysis Engine. It interacts closely with the static analysis data, using iterative prompt-based methods with LLMs to refine its understanding and output.

### Workflow Breakdown

1. **CFG Analysis (Control Flow Graph)**
   - Starts by receiving CFG string data representing the flow and relationships within the code.
   - Uses templated prompts customized with project context to guide the LLM in extracting structural insights.

2. **Source Code Summarization**
   - Aggregates evolving insights, like CFG findings and any partial abstractions.
   - Invokes the source analysis prompt to deepen the understanding of components, their interactions, and responsibilities.

3. **Final Multi-Level Analysis Generation**
   - Combines previous insights along with project metadata in a comprehensive prompt.
   - Produces the final structured abstraction output, detailing high-level design, component roles, and architecture patterns.

4. **Feedback Incorporation**
   - Accepts validation insights or user feedback to iteratively refine abstraction results for accuracy and clarity.

### Iterative Refinement Example

Imagine you're drafting an executive summary:

- First, you outline key facts (CFG insights).
- Then, you expand on implications and context (source analysis).
- Finally, you rewrite and polish the summary, applying peer feedback (feedback loop).

The AbstractionAgent operates with a similarly progressive refinement methodology.

## Key Components & Concepts

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

The AI Analysis Engine orchestrates several agents working in concert:

- **CodeBoardingAgent:** The central coordinator, managing workflow, LLM interactions, and agent orchestration.
- **LLM Provider Interface:** Abstracts communication with different LLM vendors, ensuring flexibility and consistency.
- **PlannerAgent:** Strategically plans elaboration steps, defining which components need deeper analysis.
- **AbstractionAgent:** Performs the core task of abstraction and summary generation.
- **DiffAnalyzerAgent:** Handles change detection and impact analysis between code states.

### Prompt Templates

The AbstractionAgent uses carefully designed prompt templates to structure communication with LLMs, ensuring relevant context and clarity for each analysis step. This controlled prompting enables:

- Consistency across analysis runs.
- Flexible adaptation to different project types.
- Clear separation of concerns between CFG analysis, source analysis, and final output.

### Metadata & Project Context

Project metadata — including project type, language, and domain context — is integrated into all abstraction prompts. This grounding improves the relevance and precision of generated explanations.

## Example User Flow: Generating a High-Level Component Abstraction

### Step 1: Provide Project and CFG Data

The user triggers an analysis, submitting the source code. The system extracts the CFG data and passes it to the AbstractionAgent.

### Step 2: Run CFG Step

The agent processes the CFG through the LLM, producing initial structural insights that describe control flow, key modules, and dependencies.

### Step 3: Analyze Source

Building on CFG insights, the agent analyzes specific source components, refining its understanding of class roles, patterns, and interactions.

### Step 4: Generate Final Analysis

The agent synthesizes its findings into a high-level model and explanatory output, highlighting architecture layers and functional groupings.

### Step 5 (Optional): Apply Feedback

If a reviewer or automated validator provides feedback (e.g., clarifications or corrections), the agent reprocesses its output incorporating this input to improve accuracy.

## Practical Tips for Success

- **Provide Rich Project Metadata:** Supplying accurate project context (e.g., domain, technology stack) enhances abstraction quality.
- **Iterate with Feedback:** Leverage the AbstractionAgent’s feedback mechanism to refine outputs, especially for complex or unfamiliar codebases.
- **Balance Abstraction Depth:** Adjust analysis depth settings to control the granularity of abstractions based on user needs.
- **Monitor Prompt Cost:** Complex prompts consume more LLM token resources; optimize prompt inputs accordingly.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Abstraction results are too vague or generic">
If abstractions lack actionable detail, ensure the project metadata is complete. Increase the prompt context or provide additional code samples to help the LLM discern specifics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="LLM responses are inconsistent across runs">
Variability can stem from non-deterministic LLM model behavior. Use temperature settings close to zero and fixed random seeds if supported by the provider to boost consistency.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Feedback application does not meaningfully change output">
Validate that the feedback input is precise and relevant. The agent expects structured, clear feedback in its predefined format to apply improvements.
</Accordion>
