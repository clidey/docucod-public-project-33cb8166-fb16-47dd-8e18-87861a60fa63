## Core Components Explained

### Orchestration & Workflow

The heart of CodeBoarding’s system, this component coordinates the entire analysis journey:

- Receives raw source code or analysis requests.
- Triggers the static analyzer to parse and extract structured code data.
- Checks with the persistence layer to leverage cached results or to enable efficient incremental analysis.
- Invokes the AI Analysis Engine with enriched graph data for advanced interpretation.
- Sends the finalized high-level model to the output generator for rendering.

It ensures the seamless flow and proper sequencing of complex tasks, making the analysis accurate and scalable.

### Static Code Analyzer

This module acts as the system’s eyes into the source code. Using robust Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis and graph-building techniques, it:

- Parses raw source code without AI to maintain precision.
- Constructs foundational data structures such as call graphs and structure graphs.
- Extracts essential code metadata — the building blocks for deeper AI-driven insights.
- Provides all structured data back to the orchestration pipeline and onwards to AI analysis and persistence.

Think of it as transforming a complicated codebase into a detailed map.

### AI Analysis Engine

The cognitive core of CodeBoarding, this subsystem powers insight beyond static parsing. It uses a multi-agent AI framework to:

- Interpret raw graph data from static analysis.
- Detect architectural patterns, component roles, and design abstractions.
- Analyze differences between code versions to highlight impacts.
- Collaborate across specialized agents like the PlannerAgent, AbstractionAgent, and DiffAnalyzerAgent to build a rich mental model of your codebase.

```mermaid
graph LR
    CodeBoardingAgent["CodeBoardingAgent"]
    LLM_Provider_Interface["LLM Provider Interface"]
    PlannerAgent["PlannerAgent"]
    AbstractionAgent["AbstractionAgent"]
    DiffAnalyzerAgent["DiffAnalyzerAgent"]

    CodeBoardingAgent -- "uses" --> LLM_Provider_Interface
    CodeBoardingAgent -- "orchestrates" --> PlannerAgent
    CodeBoardingAgent -- "orchestrates" --> AbstractionAgent
    CodeBoardingAgent -- "orchestrates" --> DiffAnalyzerAgent
    LLM_Provider_Interface -- "is used by" --> CodeBoardingAgent
```

This AI Engine effectively thinks about your code at a higher level — summarizing, planning, and analyzing changes to provide a comprehensive architectural overview.

### Analysis Persistence

To maximize efficiency and support scalability, this component:

- Serializes and stores all analysis models and artifacts in a structured format (JSON).
- Enables caching of previous results to avoid redundant processing.
- Supports incremental analysis by maintaining historical context and baselines.

By managing data storage seamlessly, persistence supports quick retrieval and consistency across analysis runs.

### Output Generator

The final stage turning analysis into actionable insights:

- Consumes the rich, structured models prepared by the AI engine.
- Renders outputs into multiple formats such as Markdown, HTML, and Sphinx documentation.
- Generates interactive diagrams leveraging Mermaid.js to visualize complex code relationships clearly.
- Recent updates have focused on streamlining this component for efficient, impactful output.

This allows engineers, documenters, and AI agents to consume the results in intuitive, interactive ways.

## Why This Architecture Matters

By structuring CodeBoarding in these clear, decoupled stages, users get:

- **Accuracy**: Precise static analysis ensures foundation data is trustworthy.
- **Intelligence**: AI-driven interpretation surfaces architectural insights and abstracts complexity.
- **Performance**: Persistence caching and orchestration optimize processing time and resource use.
- **Usability**: Rich outputs and diagrams make results accessible and actionable.

Together, these components facilitate smooth, automated comprehension of even the most complex Python codebases.
