# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Before you begin installing CodeBoarding, it is critical to confirm your environment meets the supported platforms, Python version, and dependency requirements outlined here. Establishing these prerequisites upfront ensures a smooth installation experience and prevents common roadblocks in setup.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

CodeBoarding is designed to run reliably on the following operating systems:

- **Windows 10 and later**
- **macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and later**
- **Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+, CentOS 8+, and equivalent distributions)**

The tool requires a standard environment supporting Python 3.9 or newer. Ensure you use one of the platforms above with administrative privileges to install dependencies.


### Best Practice

Use the latest stable release of your OS to guarantee compatibility with dependencies and Python packages.


## 2. Python Version Requirements

CodeBoarding requires **Python 3.9 or higher**. Python 3.10 or 3.11 is recommended to leverage performance improvements and new language features.

### How to Check Your Python Version:

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python --version
# or if `python` refers to 2.x
python3 --version
```

Expected output should read something like:

```
Python 3.9.7
```

If your version is older than 3.9, you must upgrade Python before continuing.


## 3. Required Dependencies

Before installing CodeBoarding, the following software components must be present:

- **Python Package Installer (pip)** — used to install Python packages
- **Virtual Environment Tool (optional but highly recommended)** — `venv` or `virtualenv` for project isolation
- **Git** — required to clone repositories for analysis

### Python Libraries

CodeBoarding depends on several Python libraries. These will be installed automatically during setup, but Python and pip must be functional first.

Here are critical dependencies installed via pip:

- `langchain_core`
- `langchain_google_genai`
- `langchain_openai`
- `langchain_anthropic`
- `langchain_aws`
- `pydot`
- `python-dotenv`
- `tqdm`

> All dependencies are managed via a `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` during installation.


## 4. Network and Access Requirements

- Ensure outgoing internet access to fetch dependencies from PyPI during installation.
- If using APIs requiring keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock), prepare your API keys before configuration as environment variables.
- Firewall/Proxy settings must allow HTTPS traffic to relevant API endpoints.


---

## Practical Checklist: Confirm Your Environment

- [ ] OS matches supported platforms (Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Linux)
- [ ] Python 3.9 or higher installed (`python --version`)
- [ ] pip functional (`pip --version`)
- [ ] Git installed and available in PATH (`git --version`)
- [ ] Firewall and network allow external HTTPS connections
- [ ] API keys on hand if you plan to use LLM integrations


---

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

### Problem: Python version is too old or missing

**Solution:**
- Download and install the latest Python 3.9+ version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Update your PATH environment variable to prioritize the new Python version.
- Use `python3` instead of `python` on systems where Python 2.x is default.


### Problem: pip command not found

**Solution:**
- Ensure pip is installed with Python (it is bundled since Python 3.4).
- Run `python -m ensurepip --upgrade` to install or upgrade pip.
- Consider using a virtual environment which provides isolated pip.


### Problem: Network connection blocked during installation

**Solution:**
- Confirm proxy/firewall settings allow traffic to `pypi.org`.
- Configure proxy settings for pip with environment variables like `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`.


### Problem: Missing Git command

**Solution:**
- Install git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Restart terminal or system to refresh PATH.

## Next Step: Environment Setup

Once your system meets these requirements, proceed to the [Environment Setup](./environment-setup) guide to configure Python virtual environments, set environment variables, and prepare API credentials.
