# Installation (All Platforms)

Welcome to the CodeBoarding installation guide for all major platforms. This document will guide you step-by-step through installing CodeBoarding on Windows, macOS, and Linux, emphasizing cross-platform compatibility while highlighting platform-specific notes to ensure a smooth setup experience.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing CodeBoarding, verify your system meets these essential requirements:

- **Operating Systems Supported:**
  - Windows 10 or later
  - macOS 12 (Monterey) or later
  - Linux distributions (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, Fedora 35+)
- **Python Version:** Python 3.11 (recommended) installed and accessible from your command line.
- **Disk Space:** Minimum 500 MB free space for installation and temporary files.
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB RAM for smooth operation.
- **Network:** Internet connection required for downloading dependencies and, if applicable, API key verification.

### Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows:** Ensure you have [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you prefer a UNIX-like environment, although native Windows installation is fully supported.
- **macOS:** Confirm Xcode Command Line Tools are installed (`xcode-select --install`).
- **Linux:** Ensure Python 3.11 is installed via system package managers or from source.

<Tip>
If you are unsure about your Python version, run `python3 --version` or `python --version` in your terminal to verify.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

CodeBoarding’s installation process uses platform-neutral commands primarily based on Python tooling. Follow the steps below for all platforms, with platform-specific notes provided.

### Step 1: Installing Python 3.11

If Python 3.11 is not already installed, install it as follows:

- **Windows:** Download and install from the [official Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Make sure to add Python to your PATH during setup.
- **macOS:** Use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python@3.11
```

- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** Add deadsnakes PPA and install:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-distutils
```

- **Linux (Fedora):**

```bash
sudo dnf install python3.11
```

### Step 2: Clone or Download CodeBoarding

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeBoarding/CodeBoarding.git
cd CodeBoarding
```

<Tip>
If you do not have Git installed, download the ZIP archive from GitHub and extract it to a convenient location before navigating into it.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment

This step isolates CodeBoarding’s dependencies and avoids conflicts.

**For all OS:**

```bash
python3.11 -m venv codeboarding-env
```

Activate the environment:

- **Windows (Command Prompt):**
  ```batch
  codeboarding-env\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```
- **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  codeboarding-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```
- **macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source codeboarding-env/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 4: Install Required Dependencies

Inside the activated virtual environment, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all the necessary Python packages CodeBoarding needs.

### Step 5: Verify Installation

Run the following command to confirm CoreBoarding CLI is accessible:

```bash
python -m vscode_runnable --help
```

You should see a detailed list of options and usage instructions, indicating the tools are ready.

<Tip>
If you encounter issues running this command, ensure your Python environment is activated and that you are inside the CodeBoarding directory.
</Tip>

## 3. Platform-Specific Special Notes

### Windows

- When activating the virtual environment in PowerShell, if you see an execution policy error, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

- Use `cmd` or PowerShell consistently to avoid environment activation confusion.

### macOS

- Ensure Command Line Tools are installed. Some Python dependencies rely on `make` and other build tools.

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Linux

- Use proper package managers and ensure Python 3.11 is the default python3:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.11 2
sudo update-alternatives --config python3
```

- You may need to install `python3.11-venv` or similar packages for virtual environment support.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Virtual Environment Won't Activate">
Check your terminal type and permissions. On Windows PowerShell, adjust execution policy. Ensure you use the activation script corresponding to your shell.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Python 3.11 Not Found">
Verify Python 3.11 installation path and add it to your system PATH variable. Use `python3.11` command explicitly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dependency Installation Fails On macOS/Linux">
Ensure you have developer tools installed (Xcode command line tools or build essentials). Check your internet connection to download packages.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
Confirm your virtual environment is activated. Run installation commands inside the virtual environment.
