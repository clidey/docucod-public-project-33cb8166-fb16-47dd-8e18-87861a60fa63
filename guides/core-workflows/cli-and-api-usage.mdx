# Using the CLI and HTTP API

This guide explains how to use CodeBoarding's Command Line Interface (CLI) and HTTP API endpoints to trigger codebase analysis jobs, monitor their progress, and integrate CodeBoarding into automated or custom workflows. It focuses specifically on the CLI commands and HTTP API routes designed for developers who want to automate onboarding documentation generation and manage analysis jobs.

---

## 1. Overview of CLI and HTTP API Usage

### Purpose
This page helps you automate and control CodeBoarding's analysis and documentation generation through:
- Command-line scripts for local or integrated use
- HTTP API endpoints for remote job orchestration and monitoring

Youâ€™ll learn how to start, track, and manage analysis jobs programmatically, enabling seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines, IDE extensions, or custom development workflows.

### Prerequisites
- CodeBoarding installed and configured with required environment variables (see Setup & Installation guides).
- Access to a GitHub repository URL or a local Python project to analyze.
- For API usage, a running instance of the CodeBoarding FastAPI service.

### Expected Outcome
- Launch analysis jobs via CLI or HTTP API
- Retrieve real-time status and results of analysis jobs
- Automate documentation generation for any target repo

### Time Estimate
About 15-30 minutes to run initial commands and understand API flow.

### Skill Level
Intermediate (familiarity with command-line tools and REST API concepts)

---

## 2. Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)

CodeBoarding offers CLI scripts for generating onboarding documentation and updating specific components.

### a. Running Full Analysis on a Local Repository

Use the `vscode_runnable.py` script to generate full analysis:

```bash
python vscode_runnable.py --repo /path/to/local/repo --project_name YourProjectName --output_dir ./analysis_output
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `--repo`: Path to your local Python project to analyze.
  - `--project_name`: Friendly name for the project.
  - `--output_dir` (optional): Directory to save analysis files.

- **Outcome:**
  - Generates analysis JSON and documentation files in the specified output directory.

### b. Partial Updates for Specific Components

If you want to update only one component in an existing analysis, specify component and analysis:

```bash
python vscode_runnable.py \
  --repo /path/to/local/repo \
  --project_name YourProjectName \
  --output_dir ./analysis_output \
  --partial_updates_component ComponentName \
  --partial_updates_analysis on_boarding
```

- Updates only the `ComponentName` in the specified `partial_updates_analysis` JSON.

### c. Bulk Documentation Generation

The `demo.py` script allows you to generate onboarding docs for multiple GitHub repos easily:

```bash
python demo.py https://github.com/user/repo1 https://github.com/user/repo2 --output-dir ./docs
```

- Clones repos, runs analysis, generates Markdown docs.
- Copies results to specified output directory if provided.

---

## 3. Using the HTTP API

CodeBoarding exposes a FastAPI server with endpoints that let you trigger, monitor, and manage onboarding generation jobs.

### a. Start a New Job

Send a POST request to create an analysis job:

```
POST /generation

Query Parameters:
  repo_url: string (GitHub repo URL)

Response:
  {
    "job_id": "<uuid>",
    "status": "PENDING"
  }
```

### b. Get Job Status and Result

Retrieve the current status and result (if done) with:

```
GET /generation/{job_id}

Response:
  {
    "id": "<uuid>",
    "status": "PENDING | RUNNING | COMPLETED | FAILED",
    "result": <URL or detailed content if completed>,
    "error": <error message if failed>,
    "created_at": "...",
    "started_at": "...",
    "finished_at": "...",
    "repo_url": "..."
  }
```

### c. GitHub Action Oriented Job API

These endpoints support broader task management integrated with CI/CD:

#### Start docs generation job

```
POST /github_action/jobs

Request body (JSON):
{
  "url": "https://github.com/user/repo",
  "source_branch": "main",              # optional, default: main
  "target_branch": "main",              # optional, default: main
  "extension": ".md",                    # output format: .md, .html, .mdx
  "output_directory": ".codeboarding"  # output dir in repo
}

Response:
{
  "job_id": "<uuid>",
  "message": "Job created successfully. Use the job_id to check status."
}
```

#### Get job status

```
GET /github_action/jobs/{job_id}

Response includes:
- job status
- result files content serialized as JSON when completed
- error message if failed
```

#### List all jobs

```
GET /github_action/jobs

Response:
{
  "jobs": [
    { "job_id": "...", "status": "...", "created_at": "...", ... },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## 4. Practical Examples

### Example: Running CLI Full Analysis

```bash
python vscode_runnable.py --repo ./my-python-project --project_name MyProject --output_dir ./out
```

Check `./out` for generated JSON and Markdown files.

### Example: Starting a Job via HTTP API (curl)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/github_action/jobs" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "url": "https://github.com/example/myrepo",
        "source_branch": "main",
        "target_branch": "main",
        "extension": ".md"
      }'
```

Response will include a `job_id` to check status.

### Example: Check Job Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/github_action/jobs/<job_id>
```

Returns detailed job status and analysis output if completed.

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- **Use Extensions Consistently:** Supported output formats include `.md`, `.html`, and `.mdx`. Default is `.md`.
- **Job Concurrency:** The API limits concurrent running jobs (default 5). Queue jobs accordingly.
- **Use Background Tasks:** When submitting via API, jobs run asynchronously; you must poll for completion.
- **Local vs CI/CD:** For local development, CLI scripts are fastest. Use API for automated pipelines.
- **Keep Environment Variables Configured:** Ensure `REPO_ROOT`, LLM API keys, and others are set as they impact job execution.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Job stuck in PENDING:** Could be concurrency limits; wait or increase capacity.
- **Failed to clone repo:** Check GitHub URL correctness, access rights, private token configuration.
- **No documentation files generated:** Review logs, confirm repo contains Python code.
- **Unsupported output format error:** Use `.md`, `.html`, or `.mdx` only.

### Logs
- CLI scripts log extensively to the console.
- API logs are accessible where the FastAPI server runs.

### Recovery
- Delete or clear temp folders if stuck.
- Restart service if jobs hang unexpectedly.
