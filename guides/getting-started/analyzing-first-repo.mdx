# Analyzing Your First Repository

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with CodeBoarding! This guide takes you through the practical steps of running your initial codebase analysis on a Python project repository using the demo script. You'll learn how to initiate the analysis, interpret key outputs, and navigate the automatically generated architectural diagrams.

---

## 1. What You Will Achieve

By following this guide, you will:

- Run CodeBoarding’s CLI demo script on a target Python repository.
- Observe and understand the structure of generated analysis files.
- Access and interpret interactive diagrams representing your codebase.
- Recognize essential CLI commands and their effects.

**Estimated duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**Skill level:** Beginner to Intermediate  

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure:

- CodeBoarding is installed and your environment is set up per the [Installation & Environment Setup guide](https://your.documentation/links/guides/getting-started/installation-setup).
- You have configured the necessary environment variables, including LLM provider API keys, repository paths, and output directories as described in [Configuration & Environment Variables](https://your.documentation/links/getting-started/configuration-first-run/config-env-vars).
- You have access to the repository URL you want to analyze (public or with credentials configured).

> <Check>Confirm your Python environment is active and CodeBoarding dependencies are installed, otherwise refer back to the installation documentation.</Check>

## 3. Running the First Analysis

Follow these step-by-step instructions to analyze your first Python repository using the demo script:

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare your target repository URL">
Identify the GitHub repository URL you want to analyze. For example, a simple public Python project such as `https://github.com/psf/requests`.
</Step>
<Step title="Open your terminal and navigate to CodeBoarding root">
Ensure you are inside your CodeBoarding project directory where `demo.py` is located.
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the demo analysis command">
Run the following command replacing `<github_repo_url>` with your target repo:

```bash
python demo.py <github_repo_url> --output-dir ./results
```

Example:

```bash
python demo.py https://github.com/psf/requests --output-dir ./results
```

This will start the analysis and save output files under the specified `./results` directory.
</Step>
<Step title="Watch the analysis progress">
The script will:

- Clone the repository locally.
- Perform static code analysis using AST and call graph extraction.
- Invoke the AI analysis engine that generates high-level abstractions.
- Validate and save analysis results, including interactive diagram JSON files.

Logs will be printed to your terminal providing status updates and any warnings.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm analysis completion">
On success, you will see a summary message listing all generated output files.

Example:

```
Generated analysis files: ['/absolute/path/results/analysis.json', ...]
```
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 4. Understanding the Output

The output folder will contain:

- `analysis.json`: The root analysis file describing main components and relationships.
- Multiple `.json` files named after discovered components/modules, each representing detailed analysis including component hierarchy, relationships, and diagram data.
- `codeboarding_version.json`: Metadata about the analysis run and tool version.

### Interactive Diagrams

Within the output files, CodeBoarding produces Mermaid.js diagram data that visualize:

- Component relationships
- Call graphs
- Structure graphs

You can open and render these Mermaid diagrams using compatible Markdown viewers, VS Code with Mermaid preview extensions, or by embedding in documentation sites that support Mermaid.

---

## 5. Key CLI Command Recap

| Command Element | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| `python demo.py` | Starts the demonstration analysis.
| `<github_repo_url>` | URL of repository to analyze.
| `--output-dir <path>` | Specifies the directory where output files and diagrams are saved.

> <Tip>If you want to analyze a different repository or save output elsewhere, simply adjust these parameters accordingly.</Tip>

---

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- **Use small or well-known repositories initially** to understand the output clearly.
- **Review log output carefully** to catch early warnings or errors related to environment configuration.
- **Leverage Mermaid.js viewers** to interact with and explore generated diagrams.
- **Iterate on analysis depth** by adjusting settings such as `DIAGRAM_DEPTH_LEVEL` to balance output detail and complexity.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Analysis">
<Accordion title="The analysis command fails or errors out immediately">
- Verify Python version (3.11 or later recommended).
- Check environment variables for missing or invalid API keys.
- Confirm network connectivity if cloning private repos requires authentication.
- Consult the installation troubleshooting page for environment and dependency issues.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No output files are generated after the run">
- Check terminal logs for errors during cloning or analysis.
- Ensure write permissions to the output directory.
- Re-run with verbose logging if available to diagnose.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generated diagrams don’t render in my viewer">
- Confirm the viewer supports Mermaid.js diagrams.
- Try online Mermaid live editors (https://mermaid.live/) to test the diagram JSON snippets.
- Open `.json` files and look for diagram sections prefixed with Mermaid syntax.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Analysis runs but results seem incomplete or missing components">
- Increase the diagram depth level environment variable to analyze deeper component layers.
- Ensure the repository contains Python code and is not empty.
- Look for warnings in log indicating skipped files due to unsupported syntax.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Navigating Generated Diagrams

After your first successful run, to explore the generated diagrams:

1. Locate the JSON files in your specified output directory.
2. Identify files for major components (e.g., `main_module.json`).
3. Extract Mermaid diagram definitions embedded in those JSON or use tools integrated with CodeBoarding (e.g., VS Code extension) for interactive exploration.
4. Follow component hierarchies and call graphs to understand module dependencies and system architecture.

> <Info>Using the CodeBoarding VS Code extension enhances this experience by allowing direct interaction within your IDE.</Info>
